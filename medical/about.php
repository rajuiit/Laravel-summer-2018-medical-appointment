                <h4>About us</h4><hr>
                <p> Smart E-Health System a dream that turned into a tech based startup, a business with a great purpose	to create positive impacts in peoples' lives. It is the first online doctor appointment service	platform in Bangladesh, providing real time doctor information and appointments through a fully	integrated system. Doctorola is missioned to bring convenience in the healthcare service delivery	for the general people in Bangladesh.</p> <br>
                
                <h4>Background</h4><hr>
                   <p> The business was founded with a strong will to solve a real problem that impacts many in the country.	The thought was kindled by the observation that people living in places beyond the major cities face	tremendous troubles in finding a right doctor at the right time and subsequently suffer in securing	treatment when they need it. Bangladesh is making significant progresses in many areas. Information	technology, without any doubt has been instrumental in the transformation of people's way of doing	things. We have seen bus, train or launch tickets being bought online. Online freelancing bringing	new skills, confidence and earnings to thousands of youths. Noticeable boost in the e-commerce.	Use of mobile money making lives better. Ironically, despite of being one of the most essential	services, healthcare has not been focused with similar initiatives yet.	There are still roadblocks	disrupting smooth healthcare delivery even today. And, information technology has rarely been	called up to effectively contribute in the sector.</p> <br>
                   
                   
                   <h4>Evolution into a Service Platform</h4><hr>
                <p>The idea of Smart E-Health System evolved into a service platform in early 2018. It was not what it is	today in the initial days. It started as a doctor's directory along with a feature for appointment	requests. After realizing that only accomplishing appointment bookings will not help much,	the whole vision was revisited. We needed to offer more. We needed to build and maintain	relationships with the patients and doctors to ensure smoother connection for the service.	We needed to add new features and extend the whole platform to accommodate many things that people	will never see working as the back office.</p> <br>
                
                
                <h4>Changing Mindsets</h4><hr>
                <p> Smart E-Health System aims to drive two very important behavioral changes that can make approaching	treatment faster and better. In general, a common person in our country is quite unwilling	to see a proper physician for his or her illness, until it gets too bad. People try out	different suggestions from friends around them or conduct a self treatment based on other's	experiences. This is mainly due to serious lack of awareness about the signs, symptoms,	consequences of diseases and lack of proper guidance.</p> <br>
                
                 <h4>The Future</h4><hr>
                <p> At Smart E-Health System, we are confident to make a difference in how people of Bangladesh approach	healthcare services. We have plans to integrate many other related services with the doctors'	appointment in the platform in coming days. The investment from BD Venture has given the	initiative more speed. Now, it's all about execution of the dreams to bring goodness out for	everyone in the country..</p> <br>
